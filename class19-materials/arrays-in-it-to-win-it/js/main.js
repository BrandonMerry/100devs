//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.

let movies = ['fight club', 'mission impossible', 'top gun'];

//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
let topMovie = movies[0];

//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable

let arryLen = movies.length
console.log(arryLen);

//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?

let lastElmt = movies[movies.length - 1];
console.log(lastElmt);
